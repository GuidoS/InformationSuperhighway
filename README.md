# INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY

Boston is full of cool Internet people. Why aren't they meeting each other?

INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY is a party gathering hackers, activists, artists, designers, nonprofits, startups, academics and general geekery to hang out and connect with one another.

- No agenda
- No "networking"
- No presentations

Just beverages, food, ideas and cool people. Best of all the price is free, just like the comic book in your cherished issues of the Boston Pheonix.
