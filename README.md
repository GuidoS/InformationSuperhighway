Boston is full of cool Internet people. Why aren't they meeting each other?

INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY is a party gathering hackers, activists, artists, designers, nonprofits, startups, academics and general geekery to hang out and connect with one another.

- No agenda, no "networking," no presentations. Just beverages, food, ideas and cool people.
- Best of all the price is free, just like the comic book in your cherished issues of the Boston Pheonix.
- This time: come out and get out from behind your keyboard and meet some free and open source committers, contributors, and users who are shaping the future of technology. Share stories about bugs, people, and communities that make you tick. We'll bring beer, soda, and food. You bring the conversation.
